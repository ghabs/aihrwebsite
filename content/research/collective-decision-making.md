# Aggregating Diverse Perspectives

This research explores how to effectively combine diverse human perspectives, expertise, and opinions into coherent, actionable insights using AI-mediated processes.

## Core Research Questions

1. How can we preserve minority viewpoints while achieving consensus?
2. What role should AI play in facilitating vs. directing group decisions?
3. How do we measure and optimize for decision quality vs. speed?

## Methodology

### Multi-Modal Input Processing
Our system accepts diverse forms of input:
- Written arguments and reasoning
- Structured preference rankings  
- Conversational dialogue
- Visual annotations and sketches

### Dynamic Weighting Systems
Participant contributions are weighted based on:
- Domain expertise relevance
- Historical prediction accuracy
- Reasoning quality metrics
- Bias detection algorithms

### Consensus Emergence Tracking
We monitor how group consensus develops through:
- Real-time opinion clustering
- Influence network analysis
- Convergence rate measurement
- Quality trajectory assessment

## Key Insights

### The Wisdom Paradox
Individual experts often outperform crowds on narrow technical questions, but diverse groups excel at:
- **Creative problem solving**
- **Risk assessment**
- **Value-based decisions** 
- **Long-term planning**

### AI as Facilitator
Most effective when AI serves as:
- **Information synthesizer** rather than decision maker
- **Bias detector** highlighting blind spots
- **Process optimizer** improving group dynamics
- **Quality assurance** checking logical consistency

## Implementation Framework

The research has produced a practical framework for:

1. **Group composition optimization**
2. **Structured deliberation processes**
3. **AI-assisted consensus building**
4. **Decision quality measurement**
