title: "Why this area?"

Technology shapes the world we live in today. The technologies we develop now — especially AI-powered technologies — will shape the world of tomorrow. 

We are concerned that humanity may fumble this ball. High stakes and rapid, dynamic, changes mean that leaders and other decision-makers may be disoriented, misunderstand the situation, or fail to coordinate on necessary actions — and steer the world into gradual or acute catastrophe. 

The right technology could help. The rise of modern AI systems unlocks prospects for big improvements here; AI tools might help everyone track the state of play, make decisions they stand behind, and act in sync with others. This could defuse race dynamics, prevent narrowly-interested cliques from exploiting less coordinated groups, and avoid catastrophic errors of judgement. 

- The world is radically underinvested in these beneficial applications;
- Many people have not yet had the space to take these prospects seriously.

This situation calls for ambitious and creative efforts.
