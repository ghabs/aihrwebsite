# Colin Megill

Colin Megill is deeply interested in problems of collective behavior and future models of open scientific collaboration. Since 2011, his work has focused on designing and building open source platforms that enable people to visualize and interactively explore high dimensional spaces.

## Research Focus

During the fellowship, Colin worked on Polis, a real-time system for gathering, analyzing and understanding what large groups of people think in their own words, enabled by advanced statistics and machine learning. Polis has been used worldwide by governments, academics, independent media and citizens, and is completely open source.

Colin developed novel methods for gathering voice and built the platform as a response to communication challenges within large scale decentralized movements evidenced in Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring. The Polis startup open sourced the technology at the 2016 g0v summit in Taiwan, and transitioned to a 501c3 called The Computational Democracy Project between 2018 and 2020. Colin transitioned from CEO of the startup to the board of the nonprofit, which stewards the codebase, the main deployment hosted at pol.is, and the mission and vision.
