# Herbie Bradley

Herbie Bradley is an AI researcher and writer. He is a final-year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, and until recently he was at the UK AI Security Institute. He tries to find the most impactful problems to solve to help make the future better with AI.

## Research Focus

For this fellowship Herbie focused on the question of how we can create the most impactful content for future AI readersâ€”concretely, around ideas for "community notes everywhere" for browsers, and AI-written wikipedia. On the latter, he worked on building evaluations to measure the current capability of models to fix errors and expand wikipedia articles, as well as prioritization work to figure out in which domains Wikidata and Wikipedia would most benefit from expansion.
