# Nathan Young

Nathan has worked on epistemic tools for 3 years. He has built tools for discourse mapping, small group voting, automating forecasts, and prediction market question generation. He has been funded by Vitalik Buterin, Jann Tallinn, and the FTX Future Fund.

## Research Focus

Nathan and Rob Gordon launched an AI Community Note writer on X (formerly Twitter). Community Notes is X's highly respected fact checking function. Their bot wrote the world's first ever approved AI community note. Their bots have since written notes that have been viewed 2M times. After launching the bot, they have been working to improve its notes and are currently working on an agent that can call tools to improve its own notes. The bot has gone through about 20 iterations, has a range of filters to remove bad notes, and Nathan has built a range of tools to compare bot versions (ELO comparison, iterating on prompts, isolating the worst notes).
