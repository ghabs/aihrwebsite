# Agita Pasaribu

Agita Pasaribu is a lawyer and AI-ethics advocate who founded Bullyid App, a tech non-profit supporting victims of online harassment and gender-based violence, reaching 2M+ people through partnerships with Meta, TikTok, UNICEF, and Indonesia's National Cybercrime Agency. She helped advance Indonesia's Sexual Violence Law and has contributed to UNESCO's AI Ethics Recommendation, advised G7/G20 on online safety, and served with the ITU and the Internet Society on global child-safety and digital-ethics initiatives.

## Research Focus

Within the fellowship, Agita is building Evidentry, a coalition infrastructure that connects survivors, online platforms, and regulators to speed up the verification and removal of AI-generated intimate imagery and other non-consensual sexual content. Evidentry has three core layers:
- Multi-detector aggregation: they fuse outputs from leading deepfake-detection models to identify synthetic deception.
- Provenance & evidence (C2PA): they apply C2PA-style provenance and structured evidence capture to generate cryptographically verifiable reports.
- Verification & takedown workflow: they verify claimant/content, then drive a platform-integrated workflow that streamlines case submission, automated evidence review, escalation, and removal confirmation.

This directly addresses today's regulatory environment. Under frameworks such as the U.S. "Take It Down" provisions, the EU Digital Services Act, and the UK Online Safety Act, platforms are expected to remove non-consensual intimate imagery without undue delay once notified. In practice, the lack of interoperable verification and provenance slows compliance. Evidentry operationalizes these mandates by providing shared, plug-in infrastructureâ€”cutting response times from days to minutes while maintaining evidentiary integrity and auditability.

Agita's research goal is to show how AI-facilitated coordination can embed accountability in real platform operations: multi-detector, provenance confidence scoring to support decisions, and verification and takedown protocols so diverse platforms can act quickly, fairly, and in line with global online-safety laws.
