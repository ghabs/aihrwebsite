# Siddarth Srinivasan

Siddarth is a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University advised by Prof. Yiling Chen. His primary research interests are in AI/machine learning, mechanism design/game theory, and public policy.

## Research Focus

Siddarth's research focuses on how AI systems can improve deliberation, forecasting, and group decision-making. His work spans topics including forecasting, reasoning, deliberation, debate, collective intelligence, bridging algorithms, and large language models.

During the fellowship, Siddarth worked on deliberation marketsâ€”a novel mechanism where explanations and arguments are supervised by an LLM. The core idea asks: "Can you persuade a reader toward the eventual ground truth?" but the reader is an LLM. In this system, instead of buying YES or NO contracts, participants write explanations of their views. An LLM reads that view, synthesizes it into a probability, and trades on that belief. The LLM decides the direction to trade based on the reasoning quality, while the money sent determines how much liquidity it consumes on the automated market maker. This approach leverages LLMs' ability to evaluate reasoning quality, ignore irrelevant arguments, and distill complex arguments into probabilities.

## Background

Siddarth completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Washington, advised by Prof. Byron Boots. During his Ph.D., he interned at Microsoft Research Montreal, Apple, and Disney Research. He also obtained an M.S. in Mathematics from Georgia Tech and a B.S. in Physics from Harvey Mudd College. Prior to his current position, he was a post-doctoral Fellow at the Brookings Institution, where he worked on AI policy.
