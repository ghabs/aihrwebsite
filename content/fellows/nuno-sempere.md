# Nuno Sempere

Nuño Sempere is a forecaster, programmer and researcher working to detect global risks at Sentinel.

## Research Focus

During the fellowship, Nuño developed multiple tools and systems for detecting and tracking global risks. His work included building the Eye of Sauron monitoring system, creating xrisk.fyi and associated tools for tracking existential risks, developing automated Twitter reports, implementing HDBSCAN clustering for risk analysis, and maintaining forecasting infrastructure and documentation. These tools are designed to provide early warning and comprehensive analysis of potential global catastrophic risks.
