# Vaughn Tan

I'm an organisational strategy researcher who builds tools for groups to coordinate better under uncertainty. I'm currently working on developing low-overhead tools for group subjective decisionmaking about strategy — these tools provide reasoning scaffolds for thinking individually and collectively about argument, value, and evidence.

## Background

I'm an organisational strategy researcher who builds tools for groups to coordinate better under uncertainty. I'm currently working on developing low-overhead tools for group subjective decisionmaking about strategy — these tools provide reasoning scaffolds for thinking individually and collectively about argument, value, and evidence. I'm a Fellow of the Singapore Government's Centre for Strategic Futures and an Honorary Associate Professor at University College London.

## Research Focus

I built a self-service webapp that uses LLMs to give users a Socratic mirror and reasoning scaffold for making subjective arguments more rigorous and evidence-backed. The prototype version is designed for college students; it is fully functional and is currently being used by small groups of college students, instructors, and educational technologists. I also have expressions of interest from startups, corporates, and governments for versions tailored for those contexts — I plan to continue this work after the fellowship.
