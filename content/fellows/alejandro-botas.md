# Alejandro Botas

Alejandro Botas is a technical builder with a background in climate startups and energy markets. He is currently focused on creating epistemic and safety evaluations of frontier models.

## Research Focus

Alejandro's work during the fellowship focused on evaluating both human and model outputs for attributes related to epistemic quality. He used LLMs to assess EA Forum posts along targeted quality dimensions, e.g. Reasoning, Clarity, and Value. He added confidence thresholds and hallucination penalties to frontier evals (HLE, GPQA) to test model calibration and is building a public leaderboard for this. He tested the model ability to identify "after" snapshots from quality-filtered Wikipedia revisions. He measured model sensitivity to epistemically irrelevant contextsâ€”probing for sycophancy and self-protective behavior. He is planning to build some of these out further in collaboration with other orgs.
