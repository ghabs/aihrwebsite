# Steve Isley

Steve's background spans sustainability, entrepreneurship, and the study of how people make decisions. At Amazon, he helped launch the Climate Pledge and led research on sustainable consumption. Today, he is focused on using AI to strengthen human reasoning and benefit humanity.

## Research Focus

During the fellowship, Steve built an AI system that generates Community Notes on X to help combat misinformation, paired with a dedicated website that hosts long-form fact checks. Each note posted on X links back to the full analysis, allowing readers to explore evidence and reasoning in more depth. This approach combines the accessibility of short-form social content with the rigor of comprehensive fact-checking, and points to a future where AI fact checking complements human reasoning.
