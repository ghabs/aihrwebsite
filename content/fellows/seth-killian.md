# Seth Killian

Seth brings expertise in game design, balance, system dynamics, and incentive fields. He has experience in startups, scaling, prototyping, and community stewardship.

## Research Focus

Seth is interested in counterbalancing defensive policy (minimizing mistakes, keeping bad numbers low) with ambitious "offensive" articulations of high-water marks (making good numbers go up). He explores whether we can scout stable collaborative equilibria and work backwards to their necessary preconditions.

His work focuses on trust scaffolds, multi-agent equilibria and their limits. Seth seeks aspirational benchmarks that can surf Goodhart's Law, and is investigating how best to canvas the existing landscape of multi-agent sandboxesâ€”determining where to collaborate and extend versus building something new.
