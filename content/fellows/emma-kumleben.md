# Emma Kumleben

Background in policy, government, and geopolitical advisory.

## Research Focus

Worked on AI for improving decision-making under uncertainty in policy and government contexts. This took the form of simulation software to assist with scenario generation and wargaming - but ultimately should look like a suite of tools helping make foresight accessible and decision-relevant across a variety of policy contexts.

Also worked on AI for sensemaking of the expanding literature on AI impacts and future scenarios, and on SF OS, a platform for collaboration between San Francisco government and civic technologists, to accelerate the adoption of beneficial AI into local government.
