# Blake Borgeson

Blake Borgeson is Co-Founder, Board Member, and former CTO of Recursion Pharmaceuticals ($RXRX), where he pioneered machine learning approaches for high-throughput cell imaging to accelerate drug discovery. He shifted his focus in 2017, since then working as a leader, funder, and advisor in AI safety and civilizational robustness, personally and via his GoodForever Foundation. He sits on the boards of MIRI, Topos, Atlas, and Palisade.

## Research Focus

Blake has been exploring how to build better collaboration tools that help groups work together more effectively, especially across different worldviews and disagreements. He is focused on extending a tool for AI-facilitated group conversations, and prototyping what he calls "social fabric" - systems that could weave individuals into groups, groups into organizations, and organizations into the broader world through smart intermediaries. He has been doing a lot of rapid UI/UX prototyping and conceptual design work, thinking through ideas like domain-specific trust graphs, pattern languages for collaboration, and ways to create membranes between different communities that let information flow intelligently. He is also working on making his prototyping workflow more efficient so he can iterate faster and test these ideas with real users. He is now exploring what kinds of organizations want to be born in this space, that he can help create via research, founding, funding, and more.
