# Maximilian Kroner Dale

Max is a behavioral scientist interested in building and testing systems that support productive disagreement at scale. He is concerned about increased political polarization and declining social trust, and is exploring evidence-based approaches to tackle those challenges.

## Research Focus

Max co-developed DeliberationBench, a novel AI persuasiveness benchmark that uses the opinion change found in Deliberative Polls as a normative reference point for 'desirable' opinion change, and compares that with the opinion changes induced by conversation with LLMs. He demonstrated this approach in a 4,000-person randomized LLM persuasiveness experiment.

Max also piloted Polis 2.0—a new version of the original collective response platform developed by the computational democracy project—in a large asynchronous dialogue. Over 1,000 quota-sampled Americans voted 90,000+ times on more than 1,000 of their own statements in response to the question: "what are your highest priority concerns with respect to AI over the next 10 years?"
