# Gordon Brander

Gordon's goal is to understand and create open-ended ecosystems through software. He believes open-ended ecosystems are where meaning is made, as the meaning comes from the system surprising itself.

## Research Focus

During the fellowship, Gordon worked on deepfuture.now, a strategic foresight tool powered by scenario methods developed at USMIL and RAND. Deep Future AI agents map out strategic landscapes, identify the forces driving change, explore multiple trajectories, and discover leverage points that can be used to shape the space of possibility.
