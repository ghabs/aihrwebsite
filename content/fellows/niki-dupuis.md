# Niki Dupuis

Niki has a background in AI/ML (MSc), and has been doing independent research on using LLMs to augment human thinking for a couple years (within the EA/AI Safety/Lesswrong blogosphere).

## Research Focus

Niki has been exploring topics in scaling bottom-up coordination, from decentralized trust building to matchmaking for collective action. He ended up settling on working primarily on using LLMs to better understand existing internet discourse, and map out the landscape of opinions, with an emphasis on detecting and preventing polarization. He also worked on a semi-automated argument mapper.
