# Luke Hewitt

Luke builds computational tools to study what changes people's beliefs, with application to AI safety, social science methodology, effective advocacy and public health communication.

## Research Focus

During the fellowship, Luke co-developed DeliberationBench, a novel AI persuasiveness benchmark that uses the opinion change found in Deliberative Polls as a normative reference point for 'desirable' opinion change, and compares that with the opinion changes induced by conversation with LLMs. He demonstrated this approach in a 4,000-person randomized LLM persuasiveness experiment.

Luke has worked as an AI safety consultant for the UK AI Security Institute, evaluating LLM persuasion capabilities. He is also a Senior Research Fellow at Stanford PACS, where he uses LLMs to simulate human experiments.
