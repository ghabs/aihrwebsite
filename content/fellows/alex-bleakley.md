# Alex Bleakley

Alex's background is in product management of enterprise machine learning infrastructure at Cloudera and AWS. Alex left AWS at the end of 2024 to focus on improving our trajectory through the AGI transition. Recognizing that group communication is integral to the most impactful decisions we make, and the existing pain points of group decision making, Alex identified a critical leverage point for helping humans make wise decisions about the development and distribution of AI.

## Research Focus

Alex built several prototypes that use AI to facilitate group sense making and decision making, including the product that would evolve to become Chord. Chord provides AI-orchestrated communication, parallelizing conversations to help groups make better and faster decisions. Alex validated customer demand and the product's impact on group decisions through extensive user testing. Alex founded Sylience to continue building Chord and execute on his broad vision for orchestrated communication.
