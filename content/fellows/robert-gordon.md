# Robert Gordon

Rob Gordon is an indie founder and systems-thinker creating collaborative reasoning tools—like Flowchart Fun and Updraft—to help groups visualize ideas, find consensus, and make better decisions. Blending product design, AI research, and coordination science, he prototypes humane, generative interfaces for collective understanding.

## Research Focus

During the fellowship, Rob built Winnow, Prune, and Updraft—three connected experiments in collective sensemaking. Winnow introduced an interactive ratification loop that helps readers and AI co-distill sprawling texts into structured, checkable statements. Prune used a fast Socratic ranking cycle where participants compare and refine ideas in pairs, exploring how deliberation can stay both open-ended and convergent. Updraft became a real-time facilitation tool for ideation and alignment—where groups and AI collaboratively map, cluster, and evolve ideas on a shared 2D canvas. He also collaborated with Nathan Young on applying similar reasoning and evaluation mechanics to Community Notes, experimenting with how AI might enhance public fact-checking and collective epistemic trust.
