# Ben Sklaroff

Ben Sklaroff is a software engineer focused on democratizing the economy as a key AI safety measure. He was previously the CTO and co-founder of Genesis Therapeutics, an ML-accelerated biotech, and before that head of software at Markforged, developing high-strength 3D printers.

## Research Focus

Ben and his team have built a multi-agent orchestration tool for coordination. Pivotal is an activity log, a shared context, and an agent platform for organizations. It integrates with the software you already use, automates workflows that might otherwise fall through the cracks, and keeps your team on track with a cohesive plan. You can use Pivotal to schedule a Google Meet with a single Slack message, and have it automatically update your GitHub work tracker based on everything mentioned in the meeting.
