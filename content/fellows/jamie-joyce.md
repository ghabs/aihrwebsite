# Jamie Joyce

Jamie Joyce is the founding executive director and head ontologist of The Society Library, a nonprofit organization that builds truth-seeking and intelligence tools to improve decision-making, scenario planning, formal inquiry, and public discourse. She also has a longstanding collaboration with the Internet Archive working to preserve previously non-digitized materials in order to improve intelligence and truth-seeking capabilities.

## Research Focus

Throughout the fellowship, Jamie and her team worked on a new semi-automated information processing pipeline and output format of mass OSINT collection, analyses, and summarization of a complex government event, which culminated in a 600+ intelligence report covering different points of view on the matter. Jamie also has been researching and consulting with experts to learn how the Society Library's structured datasets may be used as benchmarks and evals in truth-seeking capabilities and standards for LLMs.
