FLF has launched an incubator fellowship on "AI for human reasoning" to help researchers and builders create AI tools for coordination and epistemics.

32 fellows have joined and are exploring, researching, and developing potential beneficial applications, with the twin goals of:

- Scoping and developing pilot projects in strategically relevant, leveraged areas of AI for human reasoning.
- Creating fundable roadmaps for scaling these initiatives as non-profits, startups, focused research organizations, or open-source infrastructure.
