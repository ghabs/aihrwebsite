# Theory: AI for Epistemics & Coordination

The intersection of artificial intelligence and human coordination represents one of the most promising frontiers for addressing complex societal challenges. Our fellowship explores how AI systems can enhance rather than replace human cognitive abilities, focusing on three core areas that form the foundation of effective collective action.

At its heart, this work recognizes that many of humanity's greatest challenges—from climate change to global governance—are fundamentally coordination problems. They require not just individual intelligence, but the ability of groups to reason together, make decisions collectively, and align their actions toward shared objectives.

## The Challenge of Scale

Traditional coordination mechanisms—meetings, committees, democratic processes—evolved for small groups and face increasing strain as we attempt to coordinate at larger scales. Digital communication has expanded our reach but often amplified rather than solved core coordination challenges: information overload, polarization, and the difficulty of synthesizing diverse perspectives into actionable consensus.

AI offers new possibilities for coordination that can scale with complexity while preserving human agency and values. Rather than automating decisions, we envision AI systems that augment human reasoning, facilitate better discourse, and help groups navigate the inherent tensions between individual autonomy and collective action.

## Three Pillars of AI-Enhanced Coordination

Our theoretical framework rests on three interconnected pillars, each addressing a different aspect of how groups can work together more effectively in an age of increasing complexity and scale.
