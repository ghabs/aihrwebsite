From July to October 2025 FLF ran an inaugrual fellowship exploring, researching, and developing potential beneficial AI for Human Reasoning tools. We had the twin goals of:

- Scoping and developing pilot projects in strategically relevant areas of AI for human reasoning.
- Creating plans to scale these initiatives as organizations, ranging from non-profits, startups, focused research organizations, or open-source infrastructure.

Thirty fellows - with a wide range of backgrounds and subject matter expertise - joined us to explore what was possible in pushing forward the state of the art of human reasoning.
