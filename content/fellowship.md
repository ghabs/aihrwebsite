Our fellowship brings together researchers, builders, and thinkers working at the intersection of AI and coordination challenges. Over the course of several months, fellows pursue individual research projects while collaborating on shared theoretical foundations and practical applications.

Each fellow contributes unique expertise while working toward our collective vision of AI systems that enhance human understanding and enable more effective coordination at scale.
