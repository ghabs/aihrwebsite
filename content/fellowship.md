From July to October 2025 FLF ran an inaugrual fellowship exploring, researching, and developing potential beneficial AI for Human Reasoning tools. Thirty fellows - coming from a wide range of backgrounds and subject matter expertise - joined us to explore what was possible in pushing forward the state of the art of human reasoning.

The fellowship was split into three parts:
- An explore phase where fellows researched, discussed, and ideated on potential projects in AI for Human Reasoning.
- A build phase where they took their initial plans and created prototypes and real-world instantiations of the ideas. 
- A translation phase where fellows polished their work, reflected on next steps, and presented it to the world.

Below are profiles of the fellows and the projects they built.
