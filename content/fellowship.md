30 fellows joined our inaugural fellowship  exploring, researching, and developing potential beneficial applications, with the twin goals of:
- Scoping and developing pilot projects in strategically relevant, leveraged areas of AI for human reasoning.
- Creating fundable roadmaps for scaling these initiatives as non-profits, startups, focused research organizations, or open-source infrastructure.
