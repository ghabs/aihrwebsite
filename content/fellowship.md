30 fellows joined our inaugural fellowship exploring, researching, and developing potential beneficial AI for Human Reasoning tools, with the twin goals of:

- Scoping and developing pilot projects in strategically relevant, leveraged areas of AI for human reasoning.
- Creating fundable roadmaps for scaling these initiatives as non-profits, startups, focused research organizations, or open-source infrastructure.
